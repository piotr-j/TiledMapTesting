# LibGDX TiledMap testbed

Running this has same caveats ar running other libGDX projects.

There are 2 tmx maps, one with tile set with padding, other without. 

You can move the maps with touch or mouse. Move in small increments with arrows. Mouse scroll to zoom in and out.

In raw_assets directory you can find 2 directories with raw png tiles and pack files for adding the padding. There is a pack .bat as well, the paths are hardcoded so you need to fix them to pack the atlases.
